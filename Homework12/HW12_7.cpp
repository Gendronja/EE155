//Write a program to create a complete binary tree using structures and pointers. (a)Each node in the
//tree must be a variable of a new type TREE_NODE which has three fields, a field called node_value
//which is of type string, and two fields called left_child and right_child which are of type
//TREE_NODE*. (b)The root of your tree must be always accessible via a pointer variable tree_root of
//appropriate type. (c)Your complete binary tree must have four leaf nodes whose node_value fields
//contain strings AA, BB, CC, and DD, respectively.For each leaf node, the fields left_child and
//right_child must have values NULL. (d)Every non - leaf node in the tree must have the field
//node_value equal to string EMPTY; also, its fields left_child and right_child must point to the nodes
//that are its left and right child, respectively. (e)Write a function that takes tree_root as an argument,
//and prints all three field values of every node in the tree in the order we numbered the nodes of binary
//trees in our lectures.Use this function to print your binary tree.
